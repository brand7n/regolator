# Greetings from Nittany Valley, {{ $name }}

On behalf of Our Exalted Tyrant, Daddy's Home...B!#ch, it is my pleasure to present you with this rego link for NVHHH #1900, our 22nd year at the fabulous Loggia Giosue Carducci 146 Campground (aka The Sons), taking place August 1-3, 2025.

Like last year we are using our own newish, half-assed rego system. The button/link below will allow you to register and pay for exactly one-person, preferably yourself. If you wish to bring a plus one, an entourage, or whatever, respond to this email including, at minimum, an email and hash name for each individual. If you have any problems, questions, and/or concerns, you may also reply to this email.
