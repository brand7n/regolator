## Theme and Short Bus Stuff
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragnet_(franchise)">Dragnet</a> is this year's theme. And the tyrant. Hopefully that's easy enough to remember. Short bus on Saturday will go into the "Just Married Zone" and suggested attire for Saturday night's fun is...well I suppose it should be obvious at this point.

Speaking of the short bus, we are currently pushing max capacity. If you're hoping to get on, **don't forget to bring $50 cash**, and as always be prepared beg or bribe your hares (YBW and Dragnet) for a spot on the bus.

## Thursday Night Prelube
In tradition, we usually start the weekend event a day early with a Thursday night prelube pub crawl in downtown State College and an on-after party at Sux & EW's house! Pub crawl is pay as you go. If you plan on coming, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/89SxTJHaYAgr5V1q6">this brief survey</a> so we can get an idea of what numbers to expect when planning the pub crawl and party.

## Beer Share
Come join the fun Friday after dinner at Nittany at the second ever (sanctioned) event-wide Nittany Beer Share! This year our very own Truck Stop TACO takes the reigns.

You don't need to be a beer nerd! (This is how you become a beer nerd.)
All you need to be is interested and thirsty.

Here's how it works. Everyone participating brings a 4 pack or rough equivalent of beer. We will cordon off a few tables under the pavilion and gather all the brews in a few groups by style. That's the extent of the organization. From there, you just walk around and pick out beers that look good, pour a couple ounces in your taster cup, and enjoy! Try as many as you like!

What's a 4 pack or rough equivalent? That means,
- a 4pk of 16oz cans,
- a 6pk of 12oz cans,
- a pair of bombers (22oz bottle) or 750s (750mL bottles),
- a pair of 32oz growlers, or
- a full 64oz growler.

It's usually best if all the cans in a 4pk or 6pk are the same. Feel free to mix up the bottles and growlers.

What's good to bring? The answer is simply anything you like that you think others would like. Good choices are beers from your local area or your favorite craft brewery. Home brews. Rare beers you think others would not have had. You can be fancy and bring brewery only releases or just grab a 4pk you like from the grocery store. Don't sweat it, there's only a few of us that will judge you.

Untappd check-ins, know-it-all comments, long winded descriptions of what you taste at the back-end of your latest sip. All these are encouraged with pinkies up!

## Admonishments and Outro
**PLEASE NOTE: WE CANNOT ACCOMMODATE LARGE POP-UP CAMPERS / TRAVEL TRAILERS / RVs ABOVE VAN-ISH SIZE. CAR CAMPING / TENT CAMPING IS PREFERRED.** Due to our limited parking area, and the fact we must shuffle around buses, bands, etc. throughout the weekend in uncertain weather conditions, we have made this decision for the safety of everyone and to ensure we continue to be welcome at The Sons. If you have any question whether your camping rig is acceptable please contact us.

**PLEASE ALSO NOTE: For safety reasons, all of the outdoor refrigerators and freezers have been removed from the camp.** There is extremely limited space in the kitchen, and our kitchen staff/mismanagement will be using all of it to prepare your delicious meals. If we find your stinky carryout Lo Mein or other leftovers or other unauthorized food/beverage items in there, we will throw them away and laugh at you.

Please contact us if you have any ideas for skits or shot stops for the naked run. Bring a good attitude and some ibuprofen!

ON-ON,<br>
