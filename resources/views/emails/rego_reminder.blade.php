# Greetings from Nittany Valley, {{ $name }}

On behalf of Our Exalted Tyrant, DRAGNET, it is my pleasure to present you with this rego link for NVHHH #1850, our 21st year at the fabulous Loggia Giosue Carducci 146 Campground (aka The Sons), taking place August 2-4, 2024.

This year we are using our own brand new, half-assed rego system. The button/link below will allow you to register and pay for exactly one-person, preferably yourself. For the time being, if you wish to bring a plus one, an entourage, or whatever, respond to this email including, at minimum, an email and hash name for each invdividual. If you have any problems, questions, and/or concerns, you may also reply to this email.
