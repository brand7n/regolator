## Theme and Short Bus 🚌 Stuff
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Calling">Nittany Calling</a> is this year's theme.Suggested attire for Saturday night's fun is *punk rock!!*🤘🎸...think safety pins, mohawks, leather, bad (wardrobe) decisions.

SHORT BUS on Saturday will go into the "Your Favorite 70s/80s Band Zone". If you're hoping to get on the 🚌, ***don't forget to bring $60 CASH***, and as always be prepared beg or bribe your hares (TuTu Fairy, Porkscrew, and Dragnet) for a spot on the bus.

## Thursday Night Prelube🧴
In tradition, we usually start the weekend event a day early with a Thursday night prelube pub crawl in downtown State College and an on-after party at Sux & EW's house! Pub crawl is pay as you go. If you plan on coming, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/Wf3Ldkf7nKQ6f1m6A">this brief survey</a> so we can get an idea of what numbers to expect when planning the pub crawl and party.

## 🍺🍺Beer Share🍺🍺
Come join the fun Friday after dinner at Nittany at the third ever (sanctioned) event-wide Nittany Beer Share! This year our very own Truck Stop TACO takes the reigns (again).

You don't need to be a beer nerd! *(This is how you become a beer nerd.)*
All you need to be is interested and thirsty.

Here's how it works. Everyone participating brings a 4 pack or rough equivalent of beer. We will cordon off a few tables under the pavilion and gather all the brews in a few groups by style. That's the extent of the organization. From there, you just walk around and pick out beers that look good, pour a couple ounces in your taster cup, and enjoy! Try as many as you like!

What's a 4 pack or rough equivalent? That means,
- a 4pk of 16oz cans,
- a 6pk of 12oz cans,
- a pair of bombers (22oz bottle) or 750s (750mL bottles),
- a pair of 32oz growlers, or
- a full 64oz growler.

What's good to bring? The answer is simply anything you like that you think others would like. Good choices are beers from your local area or your favorite craft brewery. Home brews. Rare beers you think others would not have had. You can be fancy and bring brewery only releases or just grab a 4pk you like from the grocery store. Don't sweat it, there's only a few of us that will judge you.

Untappd check-ins, know-it-all comments, long winded descriptions of what you taste at the back-end of your latest sip. All these are encouraged with pinkies up!

## Admonishments and Outro -- 🚨**READ THIS SHIT**🚨
🚫 **NO LARGE CAMPERS / TRAVEL TRAILERS / RVs ABOVE “VAN-ISH” SIZE.**  
We have made this decision for the safety of everyone and to ensure we continue to be welcome at The Sons. We need room for buses, bands, beer, and chaos. If you have any question whether your camping rig is acceptable please contact us.

🚫 **NO PERSONAL FOOD IN THE CAMP KITCHEN.**  
Outdoor fridges and freezers are gone. The kitchen is for our glorious kitchen crew only. Unauthorized food will be tossed without guilt.

**Please contact us if you have any ideas for skits or shot stops for the naked run.** Bring a good attitude, plenty of insect repellent, and some ibuprofen!

**ON-ON,**<br>
